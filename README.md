# Product list
Components: a modal with image loading, a carousel for images and selectors. In the project I use React and styled-components.

# Features

* Modal with image loading: A modal component with a loading spinner to indicate progress until the image is fully loaded.
* Carousel: An image carousel component for navigating through multiple images.
* Color Selector: Allows to select colors from a list of options displayed as colored dots.
* Option Selector: Allows users to select text options, styled as buttons with a background color change on selection.

# What else I wanted to do
There are several additional features and improvements I wanted to implement but couldn't due to time constraints:

* Add more types with TypeScript.
* Tooltips for color and option selectors to provide additional information.
* Skeletons during loading state.
