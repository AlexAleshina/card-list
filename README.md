Components: a modal with image loading, a carousel for images, selectors. In the project I use React and styled-components.

# Features

Selectors

Color Selector: Allows to select colors from a list of options displayed as colored dots.

Text Selector: Allows users to select text options, styled as buttons with a background color change on selection.
